      <p>Hello,</p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m Minh Le, a web developer based in Greenville, South Carolina. I
        hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from San Jose
        State University. During my time in school, I primarily worked with C++
        and Java for most of my projects, but my true passion has always been
        web development. As a result, I&apos;ve been consistently building web
        apps since graduating.

        Unfortunately, upon graduation, the COVID-19 pandemic struck, posing
        challenges in my job search. Consequently, I opted to pursue day trading
        from home, resulting in a three-year gap in my resume. While day trading
        helped me maintain a stable living situation, it did impact my English
        proficiency, particularly in speaking. Just a year ago, I struggled to
        form coherent sentences in English. Recognizing this, I dedicated myself
        to daily practice, involving self-talk, pronunciation training, reading,
        and writing. Now, I can confidently say that I speak English fluently
        and am ready to rejoin the workforce.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am proficient in JavaScript and understand TypeScript well enough for
        daily use. I primarily use ReactJS and NextJS to build applications. I
        just started using TailwindCSS recently but already fall in love with
        it. My objective is to continue expanding my knowledge in web
        development. Currently, I am enrolled in AWS courses with the hope of
        one day becoming proficient in full-stack development, such that I can
        build a whole web app without help from other services.
